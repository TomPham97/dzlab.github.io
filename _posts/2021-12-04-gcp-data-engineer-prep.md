I recently passed Google Professional Data Engineer Certification, during the preparation I went throught lot resources about Google Cloud. I also read this [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/official-google-cloud/9781119618430/) but as Google update its services very often lot of the information in the book become out dated. The book is still a good read if you have little knowledge on Google Cloud services but make sure to also read the official documentation.

In this article, I compile the different resources I found most usefull/accurate during the preparation for the exam which can be useful to someone preparing for the exam. The exam itself is not very tough, although most of the questions are ambiguous and hence you need to be well prepared. You can learn more about the certification in the official page - [link](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer).


## Storage
Data Engineer role is all about data, hence the focus on storage technologies Google Cloud provides.

### BigQuery
BigQuery takes big chunk of the exam, lot questions are around how to design you table, optimize performance, migrated data into bigquery and how to use other Google cloud resources along with BigQuery.

**Overview**

- Moving BigQuery data between locations - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#moving-data)
- Partitioning tables. Based on what are they partitioned â€” ingestion time, timestamp, date. How are they named? How are they then accessed in queries? Using `_PARTITIONTIME`. - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
- How to cluster parititioned tables - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables)
- User defined functions in BigQuery - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions)
- Geospatial data analytics in BigQuery - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/gis-intro)
- Accessing historical data using time travel - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/time-travel)

- BigQuery + GCS. Know how to link tables between GCS and BigQuery as permanent tables and temporary tables. - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/external-data-cloud-storage)
- BigQuery query plan. BigQuery allows you to see the query plan and execution profile for queries that you run. Know the phases, difference between average and max time, why there can be skew in the plan, and how to optimize for it. - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-plan-explanation)
- table date range for bq. Accessing tables with dates and partitioned tables with functions like `TABLE_DATE_RANGE`, `_TABLE_SUFFIX`, `TABLE_QUERY`.  - [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22641894/bigquery-wildcard-using-table-date-range)
- Syntax for wildcards in big query names. And in legacy SQL? - [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-wildcard-tables)

**Pseudo columns**
- `_TABLE_SUFFIX` contains the values matched by the table wildcard
```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT max, ROUND((max-32)*5/9,1) celsius, mo, da, year
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod194*`
WHERE max != 9999.9 AND ( _TABLE_SUFFIX = '0' OR _TABLE_SUFFIX = '4' )
ORDER BY max DESC
```
