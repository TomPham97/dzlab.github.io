I recently passed Google Professional DevOps Engineer Certification and while preparing I went throught lot resources.
I had to go over a the documentation of a lot of Google Cloud products at no point I felt ready.

In this article, I will try to provide a summary of the resources I did found helpful for passing the exam, in addition to some of topics I wished I had spent more time reading about.


I first started my preparation by reading this book [link](https://www.packtpub.com/product/google-cloud-for-devops-engineers/9781839218019) which is a good read even if it's not focused on the exam. It does cover general DevOps practices (particularly SRE practices as recommended by Google) and lot about the GCP resources that a DevOps engineer is expected to know when working on GCP.


It is very good starting point for the preparation if you have little knowledge on Google Cloud services and DevOps.

> Keep in mind that Google update its services very often, thus any source of information other than the official documentation may become quickly out dated.

The exam is relatively at the same difficulty level of the Data engineer certification exam:
- It is recommended to have at least 3 years of industry experience with at least 1 years using GCP.
- You have format of the exam is Multiple choice quesitons, to be finished within 2h.
- You can take the exam in person at a test center.
- One difference, is the exam has 60 questions instead of the typical 50.

The exman focuses on the following areas:
- Storage: block and persistent disks
- Databases: sql and nosql databases, warehousing
- Compute: AppEngine, Compute, kubernetes, functions
- Networking: VPC, data-centers to GCP connections
- DevOps: CI, CD, deployment strategies
- Security: permissions, roles, groups, service accounts, etc.

I could not find a comprehensive resource that covers all aspect of the exam when I started preparing.
