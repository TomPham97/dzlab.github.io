## A DL tip per day!

Insipred by [jstips](http://www.jstips.co), I decide to build something similar for the Deep Learning community - checkout [here](https://dzlab.github.io/dltips/).

DLTips are shorts and useful daily tips on popular Deep Learning frameworks that will help you to improve your skills.

What is a tip? A tip is a short reading (less than 2mn) and can be on anything: conventions, hacks, interview questions, how to do something better, how to you organize your workspace, etc.

On a daily basis (or at most), a tip will be posted and tweeted, don't forget to follow [here](https://twitter.com/bachiirc).

Stay tuned to learn about all the items that the future of this awesome field of Deep Learning will holds for us.
