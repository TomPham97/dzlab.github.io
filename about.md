  Hey there! This is Bachir, a Software Engineer with strong industry experience in building enterprise products and services. I used to write [here](http://elsoufy.blogspot.com/), after a long pause I decide to start a new blog to share my hands on experience with deep learning and related stuff (computer vision, nlp, may be also some rl). Most of the articles are based on personal notes on comprehending and implementing research papers.

Thanks for reading!
